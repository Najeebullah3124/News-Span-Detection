Steps Involved:
Data Collection:

Collect a dataset of labeled news articles (e.g., real vs. fake). Popular sources include Kaggle datasets like "Fake News Detection" or other open datasets.
Each entry typically includes a headline, text content, and a label (e.g., 0 for fake, 1 for real).
Text Preprocessing:

Clean the text data to prepare it for analysis:
Remove punctuation, special characters, and numbers.
Convert all text to lowercase for uniformity.
Remove stopwords (e.g., "and," "the," "is") to focus on meaningful words.
Apply stemming or lemmatization to reduce words to their root forms.
These steps ensure that only the most relevant features are retained for model training.
Feature Extraction:

Convert textual data into numerical format using methods like:
TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency): Captures the importance of words relative to their frequency across documents.
Bag of Words (BoW): Represents text as a vector of word counts.
These features serve as the input to the logistic regression model.
Model Selection:

Logistic Regression:
A linear classification algorithm that predicts the probability of an article being real or fake.
Uses the sigmoid function to map predictions to a probability range (0 to 1), where a threshold (e.g., 0.5) determines the final label.
Logistic regression is preferred due to its:
Interpretability: Coefficients indicate the influence of each word on the prediction.
Efficiency: Computationally lightweight and fast to train.
Model Training and Evaluation:

Train the Model:
Use the preprocessed data to train the logistic regression model on labeled examples.
Test the Model:
Evaluate performance on unseen data using metrics like:
Accuracy: Percentage of correct predictions.
Precision and Recall: Measures of how well the model identifies fake news.
F1 Score: Harmonic mean of precision and recall.
Deployment:

Integrate the trained model into an application where users can input news articles or headlines for classification.
Provide predictions (e.g., "Real News" or "Fake News") with confidence scores.
Advantages of Using Logistic Regression:
Simplicity: Easy to implement and understand.
Efficiency: Performs well with smaller datasets and fewer computational resources.
Interpretability: Provides clear insights into the contribution of each feature (word) to the classification decision.
Challenges:
Ambiguity in Language: Sarcasm, satire, or biased opinions can confuse the model.
Data Quality: Requires large, balanced, and labeled datasets for robust performance.
Generalization: Models trained on specific datasets may struggle with articles from new sources or topics.
Applications:
Media Verification Platforms: Automatically flag potentially fake articles.
Social Media Monitoring: Detect and mitigate the spread of misinformation.
Public Awareness Tools: Help readers assess the credibility of news sources.
